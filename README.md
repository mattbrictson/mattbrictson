### 💬 Writing

I write about Ruby and related programming topics at [mattbrictson.com/blog](https://mattbrictson.com/blog). Here are some articles I’ve posted recently:

- [Building a better `bin/dev` script](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/better-bin-dev-script)
- [Build a modal form with Rails, Turbo, and the `dialog` element](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/turbo-modal)
- [How to organize CSS in a Rails project](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/organizing-css-in-rails)
- [The 3 Vite plugins I use on every new Rails project](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/3-vite-rails-plugins)
- [Advanced techniques for calling HTTP APIs in Ruby](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/advanced-http-techniques-in-ruby)

### 🧑‍💻 Projects

I’m currently working on:


**[bundle_update_interactive](https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundle_update_interactive)** – I’ve created a popular interactive mode for Bundler, inspired by `yarn upgrade-interactive`, and continue to add features based on community involvement.

**[nextgen](https://github.com/mattbrictson/nextgen)** – I regularly update a Rails app generator with recommendations based on my latest Rails consulting work. Nextgen embraces the fact that every project has different requirements, and offers dozens of interactive options, including Vite for apps that need robust TS/React frontends.

**[tomo](https://github.com/mattbrictson/tomo)** – This is my take on a modern alternative to Capistrano for deploying Rails apps. It focuses on a friendly developer experience: familiar SSH concepts, an intuitive CLI, well-documented extension points, and helpful error messages. I use tomo to deploy many of my side projects.

Other Ruby open source projects that I’ve built and continue to support:

- [mighty_test](https://github.com/mattbrictson/mighty_test) is a refined CLI for Minitest that adds color output, fail-fast, CI integration, and interactive watch mode.
- [pgcli-rails](https://github.com/mattbrictson/pgcli-rails) plugs into Rails apps to replace the default database console with the more full-featured `pgcli`.
- [gem](https://github.com/mattbrictson/gem) is the GitHub template I use for building and maintaining gems.
