### 💬 Writing

I write about Ruby and related programming topics at [mattbrictson.com/blog](https://mattbrictson.com/blog). Here are some articles I’ve posted recently:

- [How to organize CSS in a Rails project](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/organizing-css-in-rails)
- [Don’t reinvent the wheel with Rails exception handling](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/handling-rails-exceptions)
- [Improve your GitHub workflow with better repository defaults](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/github-repo-setup)
- [The Gateway Pattern](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/gateway-pattern)
- [Advanced techniques for calling HTTP APIs in Ruby](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/advanced-http-techniques-in-ruby)

### 🧑‍💻 Projects

I’m currently working on:

**[rails-template](https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template)** – A curation of various best practices for building Rails apps that I have collected over the years. This is always in flux as the Rails ecosystem evolves and I continue to learn from project experiences; I recently added [Vite](https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template#optional-support-for-vite_rails%EF%B8%8F), for example.

**[tomo](https://github.com/mattbrictson/tomo)** – This is my take on a modern alternative to Capistrano for deploying Rails apps. It focuses on a friendly developer experience: familiar SSH concepts, an intuitive CLI, well-documented extension points, and helpful error messages. I use tomo to deploy many of my side projects.

Other Ruby open source projects that I’ve built and continue to support:

- [bundleup](https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundleup) is a CLI for Gemfile upgrades. It’s a bit like `yarn upgrade-interactive`, but for Bundler.
- [pgcli-rails](https://github.com/mattbrictson/pgcli-rails) plugs into Rails apps to replace the default database console with the more full-featured `pgcli`.
- [gem](https://github.com/mattbrictson/gem) is a GitHub template for building and maintaining gems.
