Hi! Professionally I am a polyglot developer and engineering team leader, but in my free time and in the realm of open source, I pride myself as being a full time Ruby nerd. 🤓

Here's what I'm up to these days!

### 🧑‍💻 Projects

---

**[rails-template](https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template)** – Probably my most recognized open source project, rails-template is a curation of various best practices for building Rails apps that I have collected over the years. This is always in flux as the Rails ecosystem evolves and I continue to learn from project experiences; I recently added [Vite](https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template#optional-support-for-vite_rails%EF%B8%8F), for example.

**[tomo](https://github.com/mattbrictson/tomo)** – This is my take on a modern alternative to Capistrano for deploying Rails apps. It focuses on a friendly developer experience: familiar SSH concepts, an intuitive CLI, well-documented extension points, and helpful error messages. I use tomo to deploy many of my side projects.

**[dotfiles](https://github.com/mattbrictson/dotfiles)** – If you want a peek inside of my daily workflow (git aliases, bash scripts, homebrew packages, Sublime Text configs), this is the place to go.

Other Ruby open source projects that I've built and continue to support:

- [bundleup](https://github.com/mattbrictson/bundleup) is a slick CLI for Gemfile upgrades. It's a bit like `yarn upgrade-interactive`, but for Bundler.
- [pgcli-rails](https://github.com/mattbrictson/pgcli-rails) plugs into Rails apps to replace the default database console with the more full-featured `pgcli`.
- [gem](https://github.com/mattbrictson/gem) is a GitHub template for building and maintaining gems.
- [jess](https://github.com/mattbrictson/jess) is a Ruby wrapper for parts of the JAMF API.


### 🪴 Maintenance

I also serve as a core contributor and maintainer for the following notable Ruby projects:

- [capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano)
- [capistrano/rails](https://github.com/capistrano/rails)
